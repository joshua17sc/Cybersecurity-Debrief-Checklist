- DFPs and LPs, as required

    Debrief Focal Points (DFPs) will point at the problem to be solved by the debrief. 

    These points are directly related to the engagement objectives.
    
    In a fighter pilot engagement, this would be "Why did Maco 11 get shot down?" 

    For a Pentest, this may be "Why did we knock over the production server?"

    For an Incident Response engagement, "Why did the malware infect our team's laptop?"
