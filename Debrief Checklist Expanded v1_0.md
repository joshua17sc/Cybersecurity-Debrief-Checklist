  <summary> 1. Preparation</summary>

- Collect data 
    
    You need data for your analysis and to give examples to your audience. 
   
    Think of it like the evidence in your report.
  - Notes
    - Check ins
  - Scan results
  - Logs
  - Reports
  - Scoping docs
  - Gant charts
  - Kanban
  - Etc

  <summary>2. Analysis</summary>

- DFPs and LPs, as required

    Debrief Focal Points (DFPs) will point at the problem to be solved by the debrief.

    The DFP is a tool designed to systematically examine and communicate solutions to errors that occurred on the engagement.

        Engagement objectives support engagement accomplishment.
        Tactical objectives should support the overall engagement objective.

    DFP determination usually boils down to whether or not the mission and tactical objectives were achieved.

      - In a fighter pilot engagement, this would be "Why did Maco 11 get shot down?" 
      - For a Pentest, this may be "Why did we knock over the production server?"
      - For an Incident Response engagement, "Why did the malware infect our team's laptop?"

    From the DFP, we need to identify Contributing Factors(CFs):

        - What led to our DFP?
        - What happened that wasn't supposed to happen?
        - What didn't happen that was supposed to happen?
    
    From CFs, find Root Cause (RC).

        This will occur during the brief

    Learning Points (LPs) are errors that do not impact the overall mission results.

        - Carl did not know how to use the team's custom scanning tool.
        - Billy forgot to bring the imager to the engagement.
        - Sally included a typo in the final report in an unfortunate section.

- Set Timeline

    This will help with the upcoming review.
